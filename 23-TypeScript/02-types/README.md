# Pet TS

In this activity we will modify a ts file and compile.

## Instructions

1. change all var's to let or const depending on what is required. 
2. use the **appropriate type** for each variable (boolean, number, string, any, unknown, or null)
3. save*
4. In terminal/bash type `tsc pet --watch` this will watch for changes and compile the js as changes are made.* 
5. Run node pet.js to execute

**Types = boolean, number, string, any, unknown, null***

**Basic Types: let {varname}: {type} = {value};***

**Union Types: let {varname}: {type} | {type} = {value};***
